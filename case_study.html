    <h1>Case Study: Geolocation Rent Finder (SDG 11)</h1>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Today, technology continues to evolve day by day, offering increasingly efficient and accurate solutions to various challenges in the world. With the use of computers, which play a significant role in this progress, problem-solving has been made in ways we could never expect would be effective. A particular focus for their group is on SDG 11 which is "Sustainable Cities and Communities."</p>
    <p>Their attention is focused on a significant issue in the Philippines, which is the difficulty in finding suitable rental accommodations in urban areas. Despite the availability of numerous sophisticated websites, these platforms often fall short in providing accurate location-based information and suitable listings.</p>
    <p>Their objective is to solve this problem using technology, to simplify the process of finding a place to stay. They aim to develop a smart solution that provides easy searching for homes to rent while ensuring safety and happiness for all city residents. In doing so, they contribute to the enhancement of urban living conditions and the realization of more inclusive and sustainable cities.</p>
