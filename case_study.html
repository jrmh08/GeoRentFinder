        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p>Today, technology continues to evolve day by day, offering increasingly efficient and accurate solutions to various challenges in the world. 
            With the use of computers, which play a significant role in this progress, problem-solving has been made in ways we could never expect would be effective. 
            A particular focus for their group is on SDG 11 which is "Sustainable Cities and Communities."</p>
        <p>Their attention is focused on a significant issue in the Philippines, which is the difficulty in finding suitable rental accommodations in urban areas. 
            Despite the availability of numerous sophisticated websites, these platforms often fall short in providing accurate location-based information and suitable listings.</p>
        <p>Their objective is to solve this problem using technology, to simplify the process of finding a place to stay. 
            They aim to develop a smart solution that provides easy searching for homes to rent while ensuring safety and happiness for all city residents. 
            In doing so, they contribute to the enhancement of urban living conditions and the realization of more inclusive and sustainable cities.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h1>
        <p>Urbanization is a global trend most especially to college students in the Philippines, 
            this is due to difficulty in transportation and the need to go to school as punctual as possible. 
            Normally, students who are living far away would prefer to rent a place to stay near their school, to save time. 
            Also, this doesn’t only apply to students, it could be teachers, employees and even people with families. 
            Renting has been the trend in this society for the purpose of ensuring safety and reliability for the people especially when they need a place to stay in the meantime.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
        <p><b>Urbanization</b><br>
            Rapid Urbanization has led the country to pressure regarding urban-infrastructure, housing and services, which affects factors including rural-urban migration, 
            population growth and the economy of the country. Surveys say that the minimum price for renting a 5m x 4m, 20m² studio-type room in Cebu is ₱6,000, 
            the cheapest one near a school.</p>
        <p><b>City Maintenance</b><br>
            Despite focusing on the said challenges, many cities are still having a hard time maintaining their services due to insufficient access to basic services and 
            environmental degradation. Urban residents and newcomers in the Philippines face numerous challenges related to housing, including limited access to affordable 
            and suitable rental accommodations. According to Malaga (2022), housing facilities excel in accessibility to amenities like police stations and clinics, 
            scoring 0.79 from the compliance index. They also boast minimal noise and pollution, scoring 0.75.</p>
            <p><b>Other Rental Platforms Shortcomings</b><br>
                Existing rental platforms often lack essential features and fail to meet the diverse needs of tenants, resulting in frustration and inefficiency in the 
                rental search process. Malaga (2022) from the same research, pointed out that Some boarding houses and dormitories lack functioning facilities such as fire exits, 
                extinguishers, alarm systems, study rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms, neglecting people and students' safety and welfare.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>USER RESEARCH</h1>
        <p>According to Tianshuang, Fengnan & Yunfeng, 60% successfully rented their target housing through an app, showing that the rental mobile app has a high penetration rate 
            among college graduates; 85% of college graduates have experienced moving experience. As of the time of this research, no other studies have reported similar results 
            after this.</p>

                We have gathered that the target users of the app are students, employees, employees with families, homeowners/landlords and the admin for app management.
                We later did the user personas which will be shown below.</li>

            <li class="list_none"><h3>--> This is where users can use the app for free, but if they were to rent a unit/room, a login or signup will now be required. What we changed here
                are mainly the content of the unit profile, we made sure that the images are clearly seen, price of the unit is very visible and there is unit specifications to determine
                what kind of unit will the user rent.
            </h3></li><br><br>
            <li class="bullet_hollow"><h2>USER SIGNUP AND LOGIN</h2></li>

            <li class="list_none"><h3>--> This is where users sign up for an account or login to an existing account. Nothing was changed here in this phase.</h3></li><br><br>

                where the user can see their Rent Due Date, and also has the feature to rate the unit and your stay. Messages is also there as medium of communication, and has the feature to report 
                the homeowner in case of bad behavior/poor communication. Again, the content aspect is focused in this phase. We made sure that the users can see their due date for payment awareness.</h3></li><br><br>
            <li class="bullet_hollow"><h2>HOMEOWNER SIGNUP</h2></li>
            <img src="./docs/assets/images/sdg11 prototype homeowner signup v2.png" class="staticpics" alt="">
            <li class="list_none"><h3>--> Homeowner Signup is the same with User Signup, where users will also receive an email with a 6-digit code for email verification. Nothing was changed here in this phase.</h3></li><br><br>

            <li class="list_none"><h3>--> Logging in as a homeowner will give you homeowner capabilities. We changed a lot in this phase due to having a lot of feedbacks regarding the homeowner 
                user experience. Changes like having renters list for configuring tenants, another is the ability to create a listing. We also changed the listing input form pages to make it aligned with the 
                final and saved unit specifications. sHomeowners will also be able to chat their tenants thru the Messages Feature, plus, reporting will also be there for user/s bad behavior.</h3></li>
