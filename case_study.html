        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Today, technology continues to evolve day by day, offering increasingly efficient and accurate solutions to various challenges in the world. 
            With the use of computers, which play a significant role in this progress, problem-solving has been made in ways we could never expect would be effective. 
            A particular focus for their group is on SDG 11 which is "Sustainable Cities and Communities."</p>
        <p>Their attention is focused on a significant issue in the Philippines, which is the difficulty in finding suitable rental accommodations in urban areas. 
            Despite the availability of numerous sophisticated websites, these platforms often fall short in providing accurate location-based information and suitable listings.</p>
        <p>Their objective is to solve this problem using technology, to simplify the process of finding a place to stay. 
            They aim to develop a smart solution that provides easy searching for homes to rent while ensuring safety and happiness for all city residents. 
            In doing so, they contribute to the enhancement of urban living conditions and the realization of more inclusive and sustainable cities.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>Urbanization is a global trend most especially to college students in the Philippines, 
            this is due to difficulty in transportation and the need to go to school as punctual as possible. 
            Normally, students who are living far away would prefer to rent a place to stay near their school, to save time. 
            Also, this doesn’t only apply to students, it could be teachers, employees and even people with families. 
            Renting has been the trend in this society for the purpose of ensuring safety and reliability for the people especially when they need a place to stay in the meantime.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
        <p><b>Urbanization</b><br>
            Rapid Urbanization has led the country to pressure regarding urban-infrastructure, housing and services, which affects factors including rural-urban migration, 
            population growth and the economy of the country. Surveys say that the minimum price for renting a 5m x 4m, 20m² studio-type room in Cebu is ₱6,000, 
            the cheapest one near a school.</p>
        <p><b>City Maintenance</b><br>
            Despite focusing on the said challenges, many cities are still having a hard time maintaining their services due to insufficient access to basic services and 
            environmental degradation. Urban residents and newcomers in the Philippines face numerous challenges related to housing, including limited access to affordable 
            and suitable rental accommodations. According to Malaga (2022), housing facilities excel in accessibility to amenities like police stations and clinics, 
            scoring 0.79 from the compliance index. They also boast minimal noise and pollution, scoring 0.75.</p>
            <p><b>Other Rental Platforms Shortcomings</b><br>
                Existing rental platforms often lack essential features and fail to meet the diverse needs of tenants, resulting in frustration and inefficiency in the 
                rental search process. Malaga (2022) from the same research, pointed out that Some boarding houses and dormitories lack functioning facilities such as fire exits, 
                extinguishers, alarm systems, study rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms, neglecting people and students' safety and welfare.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>According to Tianshuang, Fengnan & Yunfeng, 60% successfully rented their target housing through an app, showing that the rental mobile app has a high penetration rate 
            among college graduates; 85% of college graduates have experienced moving experience. As of the time of this research, no other studies have reported similar results 
            after this.</p>
